# RestaurantReservationGraphQL

Basic Restaurant Reservation System using GraphQL API

## Overview

The .NET 8 WebApi project uses GraphQL using the following nuget packages: GraphiQL, GraphQL.Server.Transports.AspNetCore, and GraphQL.Server.Ui.Playground.

It configures the service in Program.cs to support GraphQL endpoints.

It demonstrates how to set up a data layer using EF Core as well as Model Design, use of Repository pattern, GraphQL Types, and GraphQL Schema and Query.

It also demonstrates the necessity to setup mutations when handling CRUD operations in GraphQL and how this can play well with CQRS pattern.
